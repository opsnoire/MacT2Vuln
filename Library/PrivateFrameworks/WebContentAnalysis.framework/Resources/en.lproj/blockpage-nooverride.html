		**** Localization notes **** 
		
		we use Javascript to break the (possibly very long) URL properly so that
		it doesn't overflow. There seem to be no way to achieve that with either 
		CSS styles or HTML for a URL which is for instance, AAAAAAAAA...(100 times)...A
		
		LoadPage(URLString, initial_max_num_of_characters, line_max_num_of_characters)

		args:
			- URLString: the blocked URL, 
			- initial_max_num_of_characters: the max number of characters contained in the first line before breaking the URL
			- line_max_num_of_characters: the max number of characters contained in the following lines 
			
		for example with LoadPage("AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA", 3, 28)
		
		the page would look like:
		
		[...]
		You can't see the page: AAA
		AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
		AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
		[...]

		Since characters on webpage are rendered as variable sized fonts, it is 
		a good idea to test manually the visual result of a long URL containing
		only "A"s, being "A" a wide character (ie. testing the worst case scenario). 
		
		Localizers might have to change 'initial_max_num_of_characters' depending
		on the length of how "You can't see the page" translate in an other language.
