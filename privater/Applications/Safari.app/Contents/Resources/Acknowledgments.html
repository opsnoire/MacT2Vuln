<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">[This is the first released version of the library GPL.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>Preamble<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any other libraries whose authors decide to use it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You can use it for your libraries, too.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you link a program with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. <span class="Apple-converted-space">        </span>Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free library.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into proprietary software.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a program and simply using it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Linking a program with a library, without changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous to running a utility program or application program.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>However, in a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries themselves.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This Library General Public License is intended to permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated in them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(We have not seen how to achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The hope is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only works together with the library.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General Public License rather than by this special one.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><b>0.</b> This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library General Public License (also called "this License").<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each licensee is addressed as "you".<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A "work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>1. </b>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>2. </b>You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>a)</b> The modified work must itself be a software library.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>b) </b>You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<span class="Apple-converted-space">       </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>c)</b> You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>d)</b> If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>3. </b>You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Do not make any other change in these notices.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>4. </b>You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>5. </b>A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library".<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The executable is therefore covered by this License.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>6. </b>As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You must supply a copy of this License.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Also, you must do one of these things:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>a) </b>Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever <span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>b) </b>Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>c) </b>If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>d) </b>Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the "Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">reproducing the executable from it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>7.</b> You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
